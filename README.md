# Motherhood_Penalty_Taiwan

In this notebook, I am going to show the descriptive statistics for the Panel Study of Family Dynamics (PSFD) dataset, the datasett I analyzed in my M.A. thesis.

The collection of PSFD was conducted by Academia Sinica, the national research institute affiliated to the central government of Taiwan (R.O.C.). PSFD includes survey data from 1999 to 2014, except for 2013. It is a national survey that asks questions about respondents' monthly salary, martial status, parental status, and so on. There were 14 different datasets from each year(survey) and I combined them together. 

For the purpose of my research, I select only employed married or formerly married women. I won't talk more about my methodology here since this notebook is a simple exploration of this dataset. Please consult to the part of Data of my thesis.
